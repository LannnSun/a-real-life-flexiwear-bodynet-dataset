Our pedestrian localization dataset comprises 429 sequences, totaling approximately 20 hours of recordings and covering 54.5 km of walking distance. The data was collected from 12 participants across 14 different scenarios in two cities and four buildings. The dataset captures complex walking patterns, including natural body movements such as sitting, squatting, and standing still, while also featuring flexible device configurations, such as various phone carrying modes (handheld, pocket, backpack), changes in phone holding methods during walking, random shaking of three devices, and adjustments to device setups (removing earphones or smartwatches). To accommodate this dynamic wearable environment, we introduce the concept of FlexiWear BodyNet (Flexible Wearable Body Network), which describes the natural variations in device placement and the intricate body network under complex walking patterns. This dataset is collected using Apple Suite (iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods), with IMU data sampled at 100Hz, 100Hz, and 25Hz for the three devices, respectively, and VIO data at 30fps, providing high-quality, multi-scenario sensor data for pedestrian localization research in complex walking conditions.
